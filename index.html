            <p>Hi! I am <span class="special-green">Roma Mudnal</span>! I am a dedicated student at UT Austin, pursuing degrees in CS Honors and Canfield Business Honors. </p>

            <p></p>

            <p>I am the lovely and beautiful girlfriend to the lovely and esteemed <a class="special-green" href="https://nathan.rs">Nathan Barry</a>! He is also a CS major at UT, partaking in the 5 year masters program. So yay me - I get another 2 years with him!</p>

            <h2>Shower Thoughts</h2>
            <p>I like to be competitive. In my free time, I like to play pickleball with my boyfriend. We are that power couple that crushes our opponents. I also enjoy cooking and baking. My special recipes include mouth-watering pasta (with cream cheese, of course!) and goop rice (a name coined by the one and only Nathan Barry). I also like to crochet, and I have a fair collection of knit tops that I have created with my own two hands, marred by dust and sweat and blood. One day, I hope to be super smart and wealthy and have zero kids of my own!</p>
